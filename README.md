# Weather data in France

This project is part of my PhD thesis. 

_(still work in progress)_

## Objectives

I present how to:

- download weather data in ``nc_data`` format from Copernicus
- extract relevant information
- create a panel data at the municipal level with precipitations and temperature


## Software used

The project is written in R, and mainly uses ``terra`` and ``sf`` packages.
